## Adding to the file 

New additions should abide the following rules

### Only use relevant fields

Don't use DOIs

Don't use URLs, except for working papers 

Don't use abstract={}

Don't use note={}

Don't link to PDFs on your laptop


### citation index values

`lastname1stauthor:year`  (all lower)(one author) 
liu:2020 (for Liu (2020))

`lastname1stauthor:lastname2ndauthor:year`  (two authors) 

liu:Sullivan:2020 (for Liu and Sullivan (2020))

`lastname1stauthor:etal:year`   (more than two authors) 

liu:etal:2020  (for Kim, Liu, Desmarais (2020))

### Author names and initials 

For author names in the citations make sure that the full name is available, 
this is problematic in scholar.google.com citations
i.e., Michael D. Ward not M.D. Ward

Full initials that are abbreviations need a period
i.e., Michael D. Ward not Michael D Ward

### Journal Names

Do not use journal abbreviations. Make sure that all words in the title of the journal are capitalized.

Journal of Peace Research 

not Journal of peace research 

not J. of Peace Res.

### Titles 

Titles should be in environment delimiters {}

Actually, all fields should be in delimiters {} 

Ideally, All Titles Should Be In CamelCase  

Thus, title={A Big, Huge Idea} 

not title={A big, huge idea}
